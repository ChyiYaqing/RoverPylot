RoverPylot (whith py3 & CV)
==========

**[Original READ.ME](https://github.com/simondlevy/RoverPylot/blob/master/README.md)**

1. In [rover](https://github.com/Nehc/RoverPylot/tree/master/rover) add support for python3 (python2 works too)
2. Add file [cv_revolution.py](https://github.com/Nehc/RoverPylot/blob/master/cv_revolution.py), where ffmpeg-pipe used (no tempfile) and Open-CV2 used for view and control vehicle (good for any CV|ML experiments).
